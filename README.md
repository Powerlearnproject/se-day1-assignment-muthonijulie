#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

## Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering involves desgining, developing and maintaining software.Software engineering is essential since it enables solving of software problems by coming up with softwares that are able to handle the day to day activities.

## Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Early programming-Software development was ad-hoc and tightly couples in the early days of computing and programs were written in assemby or machine languages which were difficult to maintain and modify.
Strucured programming-Introduction of this helped developers organize code into blocks and use control structures which improved program readability and reduced erros in large systems.

AI and Machine Learning in Software Engineering : Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are now being applied to optimize software development processes. Tools that assist with code generation, bug detection, and project management have emerged, pushing the boundaries of automation in software engineering.

## List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement gathering-In this phase, information gathering and requirements of what a customer needs is done which enables the stakeholders to determine the requirements
Analysis-this stage involves defining and documenting the product requirement to get them approved by the customers.
Design-specifies hardware and system requirements and helps to define overall system architecture.
Development-Developers use programming tools like compilers to generate and implement code.
Testing-This happens against the requirements to make sure that the product is solving the needs addressed and gathered during requirements phase.
Deployment-The product is deployed to the customer for use and beta testing I performed.
Maintenance-This involves optimization,correction of errors ,enhancement of existing features and deletion of discarded features.

## Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology-In this method, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and a review is done at the end of each phase.Can be used in smaller projects where requirements are well understood
Agile methodology-this is a combination of iterative and incremental process models which focuses on process adaptability and customer satisfaction. Used where a medium sized product is needed for sale

## Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer-writes,maintains and enhance software code to implement thee desired functionality.
Responsibility:
Identify and fix bugs in the code
Collaborate with the technical team to design the system architecture
Translate requirements into functional software features and ensure the business objectives are met
Review codes written by other developers to ensure quality,consistency and adherence to coding standards

Quality assurance engineer-ensures the quality of the software through systematic testing and validation to ensure it meets the required standards before being released to users
Responsibility:
Develop test plans and strategies that define how the software will be tested
Create test cases and scripts to validate that the software perform as expected.
Identify and document defects in the software working closely with developers to resolve issues.

Project manager-oversees the planning, estimating and scheduling project development and assigning people tasks.
Responsibility:
Asses risks, monitors the, and take action when need arises
Manages a team of developers
Manages the projectâ€™s budget ensuring that resources are allocated effectively and the project stays within the financial constraints.

## Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environment enable programmers to develop software code efficiently. Eg Visual studio code
Version control systems allows developers to track necessary changes to their code ,collaborate and revert earlier versions of their code if necessary. Example:github

## What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Experiences evolving requirements due to market changes which can lead to delays.
Strategy:Ensure continuous communication with stakeholders to clarify requirements and set realistic expectations.
Accumulation of technical debts due to rushed code,lack of factoring which can lead to difficulty in maintaining the system.
Strategy: Regularly refactor code to improve its quality and maintainability without altering its functionality.
Poor time management especially in trying to estimate the amount of time that can be taken to develop the product
Strategy:Break larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones each with its own estimate.

## Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing:testing of individual units of a software application.
It helps to identify bugs early in the development process before they become more difficult and expensive to fix.
Integration testing: testing how different units of a software application interact with each other.
It ensures that the different units of the software work together as intended.
System testing-evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution.\It will test the entire product so that detection of erros cannot be identified during unit testing and integration testing.
Acceptance testing-this is a formal testing conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria or not.
Enables the project team to know the further requirements from the users directly as it involves the users for testing.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

## Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to guide the behavior and outputs of AI models.
Importance:
Enables AI models to generate more accurate relevant and high quality responses.
Allows users to extract maximum value from AI systems across various applications.
Well crafted prompts can lead to precise outputs in fewer attempts reducing the need for repeated trials.

## Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example:
Tell me about technology
Improved prompt:
Define technology and explain its effect in the world today and how we can use it to improve ourselves.
The improved prompt is clearer because it has given what aspect of technology to fouc on:effects,definition. This reduces ambiguity and ensure AI does not provide generalized response.

Why improved prompt is more effective:
Directs AI to focus on a specific, relevant topic which results in a more useful and targeted output.
It provides structure,effects and definition, so the response is well organized rather than general.
