#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

    1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering involves desgining, developing and maintaining software.Software engineering is essential since it enables solving of software problems by coming up with softwares that are able to handle the day to day activities.

    2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
Early programming-Software development was ad-hoc and tightly couples in the early days of computing and programs were written in assemby or machine languages which were difficult to maintain and modify.
Strucured programming-Introduction of this helped developers organize code into blocks and use control structures which improved program readability and reduced erros in large systems.

AI and Machine Learning in Software Engineering : Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are now being applied to optimize software development processes. Tools that assist with code generation, bug detection, and project management have emerged, pushing the boundaries of automation in software engineering.
   
3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement gathering-In this phase, information gathering and requirements  of what a customer needs is done  which enables the stakeholders to determine the requirements
Analysis-this stage involves defining and documenting the product requirement to get them approved by the customers.
Design-specifies hardware and system requirements and helps to define overall system architecture.
Development-Developers use programming tools like compilers to generate and implement code.
Testing-This happens against the requirements to make sure that the product is solving the needs addressed and gathered during requirements phase.
Deployment-The product is deployed to the customer for use and beta testing I performed.
Maintenance-This involves optimization,correction of errors ,enhancement of existing features and deletion of discarded features.

    
4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology-In this method, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and a review is done at the end of each phase.Can be used in smaller projects where requirements are well understood
Agile methodology-this is a combination of iterative and incremental process models which focuses on process adaptability and customer satisfaction. Used where a medium sized product is needed for sale
    
5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-writes,maintains and enhance software code to implement thee desired functionality.
Responsibility:
Identify and  fix bugs in the code
Collaborate with the technical team to design the system architecture
Translate requirements into functional software features and ensure the business objectives are met
Review codes written by other developers to ensure quality,consistency and adherence to coding standards
Quality assurance engineer-ensures the quality of the software through systematic testing and validation to ensure it meets the required standards before being released to users
Responsibility:
Develop test plans and strategies that define how the software will be tested
Create test cases and scripts to validate that the software perform as expected.
Identify and document defects in the software working closely with developers to resolve issues.

Project manager-oversees the planning, estimating and scheduling project development and assigning people tasks.
Responsibility:
Asses risks, monitors the, and take action when need arises
Manages a team of developers
Manages the projectâ€™s budget ensuring that resources are allocated effectively and the project stays within the financial constraints.
